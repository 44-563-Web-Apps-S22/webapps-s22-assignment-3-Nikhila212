 <h2>CODE DISPLAY</h2>

 <blockquote = "https://wcipeg.com/wiki/Convex_hull_trick">The convex hull trick is a technique 
      (perhaps best classified as a data structure) used to determine efficiently, after preprocessing,
       which member of a set of linear functions in one variable attains an extremal value for a given 
       value of the independent variable</blockquote>
