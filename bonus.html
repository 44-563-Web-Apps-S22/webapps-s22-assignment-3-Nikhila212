            A mascot is any human, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything used to 
            represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, professional sports 
            team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots are also used as fictional, 
            representative spokespeople for consumer products.
            Here our mascot is an animal called Nightingale of brown color and it is in support of a soccer sports team.
